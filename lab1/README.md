# Lab 1: Collaborative Perception for Autonomous Vehicles

## Objectives:
1. Learn to process and visualize LiDAR data from IRSU for vehicle perception.
2. Understand how to enhance vehicle perception using data from other vehicles and IRSU.
3. Develop skills in constructing an occupancy grid for environmental mapping.

## Description:
This lab focuses on the utilization of Intelligent Road-Side Unit (IRSU) data, particularly in the context of enhanced vehicle perception and environment mapping. Students will work with LiDAR data and learn how to effectively visualize and interpret this data for autonomous vehicle applications.

## Steps:
1. Task 1 - Visualizing LiDAR Data from IRSU:
   - Process and visualize point cloud data from a 32-channel LiDAR.
   - Modify functions in `visualization.py` and `utils.py` to represent the data effectively.

2. Task 2 - Enhancing Vehicle Perception with IRSU Data:
   - Learn how IRSU data can enhance the vehicle's field of view and perception range.
   - Modify and utilize functions in `utils.py` to integrate data from various sources.

3. Task 3 - Building an Occupancy Grid:
   - Construct a Bird's Eye View (BEV) occupancy grid of the environment.
   - Understand the significance of occupancy grids in autonomous vehicle navigation.

## Expected Learning Outcomes:
- Proficiency in visualizing and interpreting LiDAR data.
- Knowledge of how IRSU data can augment vehicle perception capabilities.
- Skills in environmental mapping through occupancy grid construction.
